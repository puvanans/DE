## 🔍 Project Goals

- Track performance of ETFs by **sector** and **investment style**
- Analyze the impact of **P/E ratios** as a proxy for market sentiment
- Compare ETF trends against **macroeconomic indicators** (inflation, interest rates, etc.)
- Use this as a case study in long-term, data-driven investing
- Build a full data pipeline using modern tools to showcase Data Engineering skills
